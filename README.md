# Credit Score Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify credit scores based on customer demographics and financial data. The model is created using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and optimized using cross-validation.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Features**: Age, Income, Education, Number of Children, Gender, Marital Status, Home Ownership
- **Objective**: To predict a customer's credit score based on input data.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Validation**: Performed to find the optimal number of neighbors in the KNN model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used classification reports to assess model performance on both training and testing datasets.
- **Model Deployment**: The trained KNN model is saved as a `.pkl` file for reuse.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-score-classification.git
   cd credit-score-classification
